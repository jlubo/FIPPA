# FIPPA: The Functional Interplay between Plasticity Processes on Arbor

The goal of the FIPPA project was to extend the neural network simulator
[Arbor](https://arbor-sim.github.io) by key plasticity processes that
allow to simulate and analyze the long-term adaptive dynamics of
large-scale, morphologically-detailed neuronal networks. The models
were ported and augmented in correspondence to neuro-theoretical
investigations by the [Tetzlaff research group](https://tetzlab.com) at
University of GÃ¶ttingen.

## Arbor implementations -- FIPPA output

* [Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)](STDP)
* [Spike-based homeostasis](spike_based_homeostasis)
* [Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neuron](AdEx)
* [Synaptic tagging and capture (STC) in recurrent networks of point neurons](https://github.com/tetzlab/arbor_network_consolidation)

## Arbor implementations -- based on FIPPA

* Calcium-based synaptic plasticity
* Heterosynaptic calcium-based plasticity in dendrites
* Synaptic tagging and capture (STC) in recurrent networks of morphological neurons
